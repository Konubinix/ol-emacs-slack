* Org link for Emacs Slack

This is a bit of code to make Org links from Emacs Slack buffers.
Note that this is a work in progress, so the links point to the
buffers. If necessary, I will look into how to make them point to the
exact line of the conversation.

** Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-09-11 Fri 23:55]
:END:

Load the Elisp file like this:

#+begin_src elisp
(load "ol-emacs-slack.el")
(require 'ol-emacs-slack)
#+end_src

Then visit an Emacs Slack buffer and run =org-store-link= to store a
pure Org Link to that buffer.
