* Org link for Emacs Slack

This is a bit of code to make Org links from Emacs Slack buffers.
Note that this is a work in progress, so the links point to the
buffers. If necessary, I will look into how to make them point to the
exact line of the conversation.

** Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-09-11 Fri 23:55]
:END:

Load the Elisp file like this:

#+begin_src elisp
(load "ol-emacs-slack.el")
(require 'ol-emacs-slack)
#+end_src

Then visit an Emacs Slack buffer and run =org-store-link= to store a
pure Org Link to that buffer.

** Ideas on how to use this

I use this to add link to my Org Agenda when I receive message
similarly to what I wrote about in
https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/08/14/slack-messages-in-your-org-agenda/

#+begin_src elisp :noeval
(use-package alert
  :after slack
  :init
  (alert-define-style
   'my/alert-style :title
   "Make Org headings for messages I receive - Style"
   :notifier
   (lambda (info)
     (when (get-buffer "Slack.org") (with-current-buffer "Slack.org" (save-buffer)))
     (write-region
      (s-concat
       "* TODO "
       (plist-get info :title)
       " : "
       (format
        "[[emacs-slack:%s][%s]] :slack:"
        (plist-get info :title)
        (s-truncate 127 (s-replace "\n" ";" (plist-get info :message))))
       "\n"
       (format "<%s>" (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"))
       "\n"
       (plist-get info :message)
       "\n")
      nil
      "~/<yourPath>/Slack.org"
      t)))
  (setq alert-default-style 'message)
  (add-to-list 'alert-user-configuration
               '(((:category . "slack")) my/alert-style nil)))

#+end_src

Hopefully it is helpful to you as well.
